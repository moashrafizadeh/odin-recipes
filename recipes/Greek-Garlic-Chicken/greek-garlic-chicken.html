        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This recipe was passed down through my family for years. If you're looking for a great tasting, tender chicken breast, this is what you're looking for - Greek style.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
            <li>1 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 lemon juiced</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons crushed garlic</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1.5 teaspoons black pepper</li>
            <li>1/3 teaspoon paprika</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut 3 slits in each chicken breast to allow marinade to penetrate. In a small bowl, whisk together olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, salt, pepper, and paprika for about 30 seconds. Place chicken in a large bowl, and pour marinade over. Using your hands, work marinade into chicken. Cover, and refrigerate overnight.</li>
            <li>Preheat grill for medium heat, and lightly oil grate.</li>
            <li>Cook chicken on grill until meat is no longer pink and juices run clear.</li>
        </ol>
